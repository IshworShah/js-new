// // {} => its called object declaration when its comes with object.... 
// // {} => its called scope when its use with function and if/else or anything in programming language ....eg: scope of function or program


// //global scope          // Variables declared outside the {} block called global scope.
// //Global scope variables are available on block scope, but the value written inside block scope should not go outside, i.e., global scope.
     
// let a = 500
// const b = 600
// var c = 400     

// //block scope       // Variables declared inside the {} block called block scope.
// //Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

// if(true){
// let a = 10
// const b = 20   
// // var c = 30          // Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope. 

// // console.log(a);
// // console.log(b);
// // console.log(c);

// }

// // In simpler terms, the code written inside the block scope {} should operate inside the block scope only...
// // But code written in the global scope i.e. outside of block scope { } can also be accessed and operated on from within the block scope.
// // console.log(a);
// // console.log(b);
// // console.log(c);

// //Notes : The global scope you check in the browser console and the example you run in Node.js in your code environment are different.
